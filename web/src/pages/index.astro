    <p>
      Ever since I was a child, I've been fascinated by technology. Nevertheless, I quickly found myself tinkering with
      the computer for hours if given the chance. Turns out hacking together Lua scripts for video games taught me a
      thing or two about coding. A lot has changed since then, but I still found myself in front of the computer, but
      tinkering around with some code instead. <br><br>
      
      Since then, I've built multiple web applications, managed software teams,
      and designed scalable software architectures, all while juggling volunteering, work, and university.
      
      Fast forward to today, I've just finished my Master's degree in Informatics from NTNU and moved to Oslo. I currently work at
      <Link aria-label="Link to liflig" href="https://www.capraconsulting.no/dette-kan-vi/liflig">Liflig</Link> as a full-stack developer with a passion for web applications. In my spare time, you might find me playing
      video games, reading books, developing open-source software, or working out.<br><br>

    I've worked on multiple projects, from commercial ones to small hobby projects.

     During my free time, I love working on open-source projects. Here are some of my open-source highlights.
